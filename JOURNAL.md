## 10/10/2025 - The First Days of Thinking & Shopping  

So, this is meant to be a somewhat simple project, where I design and build my own mini arcade cabinet but specifically for BeatBlock! I got the initial inspiration from [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/IKot38adb68) where they used a crank to control Cranky, and I really wanted to try it too. Since I have had way too much fun with beatblock, why not share this game with other people and build something cool?

It all started last Saturday (10/4) with some discussions about making a mini desktop arcade unit for our club, and honestly, the appealing part about such a project is that it is simple and mostly plug and play. The hard part is the coding (I have a lot to learn) and actually designing the whole unit in CAD to be 3D printed. 

That day, I began looking for the parts that I will need and will buy, along with the features I want. On Sunday (10/5), I chose the final parts and ordered it ahead, since I am sourcing my parts from China. A lot of thoughts on the features I wanted came up, here are some of them:

- Have a crank and buttons for taps and navigation
- No joystick since it does not fit
- Proper ventilation and cooling
- Haptic feedback (eventually landed on a BLDC for that)
- Bright screen (500cd/m^2) for outdoor shade use
- Proper navigation control with the buttons and crank
- And lastly, big speakers for the best sound

Last thing, I made a quick sketch in Fusion to see how the button and crank layout will work, after a lot of consideration on whether to keep the crank on the left or right, I decided right would be better in my opinion, and I finished off the night with that. 

This is your prequel of the beatblock arcade, I will start pushing out regular updates from there!
