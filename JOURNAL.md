This is my journal of the design and building process of **BeatBlock Mini Desktop Arcade**.

## 10/10/2025 - The First Days of Thinking & Shopping  

So, this is meant to be a somewhat simple project, where I design and build my own mini arcade cabinet but specifically for BeatBlock! I got the initial inspiration from [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/IKot38adb68) where they used a crank to control Cranky, and I really wanted to try it too. Since I have had way too much fun with beatblock, why not share this game with other people and build something cool?

It all started last Saturday (10/4) with some discussions about making a mini desktop arcade unit for our club, and honestly, the appealing part about such a project is that it is simple and mostly plug and play. The hard part is the coding (I have a lot to learn) and actually designing the whole unit in CAD to be 3D printed. 

That day, I began looking for the parts that I will need and will buy, along with the features I want. On Sunday (10/5), I chose the final parts and ordered it ahead, since I am sourcing my parts from China. A lot of thoughts on the features I wanted came up, here are some of them:

- Have a crank and buttons for taps and navigation
- No joystick since it does not fit
- Proper ventilation and cooling
- Haptic feedback (eventually landed on a BLDC for that)
- Bright screen (500cd/m^2) for outdoor shade use
- Proper navigation control with the buttons and crank
- And lastly, big speakers for the best sound

Last thing, I made a quick sketch in Fusion to see how the button and crank layout will work, after a lot of consideration on whether to keep the crank on the left or right, I decided right would be better in my opinion, and I finished off the night with that. 

This is your prequel of the beatblock arcade, I will start pushing out regular updates from there!  

## 10/11/2025 - CAD Designing & Sketch Mockup  

Second update! This time, I have made most of the parts that will fit inside the arcade based on the product images and dimensions, with some of them, I will have to wait for them to arrive since the seller didn't show measurement dimensions. Also, for some of them, I was able to find the exact CAD files online on GrabCAD. Here are some of them:

After making and downloading most of the parts, I went on to make the rough shape of the actual arcade, it took a while to get the angles of the panels to look right, but I think I'm pretty happy with it.

Here, there are 4 buttons on top, and 2 on the bottom side, and the two 4 inch speakers are on top facing down. I haven't gotten the time to design the sides or the back features yet, and am thinking on how I should make the design of the arcade cabinet. That's all I did for now, time to play some beatblock (you should too)!
